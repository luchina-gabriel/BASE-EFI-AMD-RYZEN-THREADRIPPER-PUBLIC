# Compatible SMBIOS

SMBIOS|Description
:----|:----
iMacPro1,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.
MacPro7,1|AMD RX Polaris and newer.<br>Note that MacPro7,1 is exclusive to macOS 10.15, Catalina and newer.
MacPro6,1|AMD R5/R7/R9 and older.
iMac14,2|Nvidia Kepler and newer.<br>Note: iMac14,2 is only supported to macOS 10.8-10.15, for macOS 11, Big Sur and newer please use MacPro7,1.

# Catalina and older versions of macOS

- Please configure `MinDate` and `MinVersion` in UEFI > APFS to `-1`;
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` in Misc > Security to `j137`;

\* *Without above settings, macOS will not be able to boot.*

# macOS Sonoma 14.4 or above versions (including macOS Sequoia (v15))
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` to `Disabled`;
- After the installation is completed, you can return the value to 'Default';
- If the above adjustment is not performed, the installation will be in a looping.

# Special notes

- USB port mapping is **REQUIRED**.
- **`XhciPortLimit`** - Please `**ENABLE**` to map the USB ports
	- You can use USBMap.command Utility - [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).
- **`SetupVirtualMap`** in config.plist:
	- B550, A520 and TRx40 boards should **`DISABLE`** this;
	- Newer BIOS versions of X570 also require this **`DISABLE`**;
	- X470 and B450 with late 2020 BIOS updates also require this **`DISABLE`**.
- **`DevirtualiseMmio`** - TRx40 users please **`ENABLE`** this flag.

## Special notes - Mapping CORES for AMD CPU

**Note for Zen 4:** Zen 4 (Ryzen 7000) requires patching for IOPCIFamily.kext. <br>
This patch is enabled by default. Please ensure that you've added it to your current config for Zen 4 stability. <br>
This patch also allows MSI A520, B550, and X570 boards to boot macOS Monterey and newer. <br>

Core Count patch needs to be modified to boot your system.<br>
Find the four `algrey - Force cpuid_cores_per_package` patches and alter the `Replace` value only.

|   macOS Version      | Replace Value | New Value |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| 10.13.x, 10.14.x     | B8000000 0000 | B8 < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 10.15.x, 11.x        | BA000000 0000 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0000 |
| 12.x, 13.0 to 13.2.1 | BA000000 0090 | BA < Core Count > 0000 0090 |
| 13.3                 |  BA000000 00  | BA < Core Count > 0000 00 |

From the table above substitue `< Core Count >` with the hexadecimal value matching your physical core count. <br>
Do not use your CPU's thread count. <br>
See the table below for the values matching your CPU core count.

| Core Count | Hexadecimal |
|------------|-------------|
|   2 Core   |     `02`    |
|   4 Core   |     `04`    |
|   6 Core   |     `06`    |
|   8 Core   |     `08`    |
|   12 Core  |     `0C`    |
|   16 Core  |     `10`    |
|   24 Core  |     `18`    |
|   32 Core  |     `20`    |

So for example, a user with a 6-core processor should use these `Replace` values: `B8 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0000` / `BA 06 0000 0090` / `BA 06 0000 00`

**Note:** *MacOS Monterey installation requires `Misc -> Security -> SecureBootModel` to be disabled in the config.<br />Also TPM needs to be disabled in the BIOS. Both can be enabled after install.*

# Special notes [DeviceProperties > Add]

- PLEASE EDIT/ADD DEVICE FOR ETHERNET i225 (You can identify with Hackintool on `PCIe` tab).
	- If your board didn't ship with the Intel I225 NIC, there's no reason to add this entry.
	- If you get a kernel panic on the `AppleIntelI210Ethernet` kext, your Ethernet's path is likely `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)`.
	- Please **`ENABLE`** Patch for i225 on `Kernel > Patch`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.2.1 and below, please add `dk.e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.3 or newer, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Ventura, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args` and add Kext [AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext](https://github.com/luchina-gabriel/youtube-files/raw/main/AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext.zip)

## TRX40 Systems

Disabling the `mtrr_update_action - fix PAT` patch has shown an improvement in GPU performance on some systems that have tested. If you wish to test this it is recommended to do so on a USB with OpenCore to ensure it works first. There may be issues with different motherboard/GPU combos that we aren't aware of. Proceed at your own risk.

### General Purpose `boot-args`

Parameter|Description
:----|:----
npci=0x2000|This disables some PCI debugging related to `kIOPCIConfiguratorPFM64`, alternative is `npci=0x3000` which disables debugging related to `gIOPCITunnelledKey` in addition.<br>Required for when getting stuck on `PCI Start Configuration` as there are IRQ conflicts relating to your PCI lanes. **Not needed if Above4GDecoding is enabled.**
npci=0x3000|Alternative for `npci=0x2000`.

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`

Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series & RX 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).
nvda_drv_vrl=1|Used for enabling Nvidia's Web Drivers on Maxwell and Pascal cards in Sierra and High Sierra.

### Ethernet (Intel i225) `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
dk.e1000=0|Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it is required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.<br>You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.
e1000=0|for macOS 12.3.1 or newer<br>Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it is required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.<br>You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.

# BIOS Settings

### Disable
- Fast Boot
- Secure Boot
- Serial/COM Port
- Parallel Port
- Compatibility Support Module (CSM)(Must be off, GPU errors like `gIO` are common when this option in enabled)

***Special note for 3990X users***: *macOS currently does not support more than 64 threads in the kernel, and so will kernel panic if it sees more. The 3990X CPU has 128 threads total and so requires half of that disabled. We recommend disabling hyper threading in the BIOS for these situations.*

### Enable
- Above 4G decoding
	- This must be on, if you can't find the option then add `npci=0x2000` to `boot-args`. 
	- Do not have both this option and `npci` in `boot-args` enabled at the same time.
	- If you are on a Gigabyte/Aorus or an AsRock motherboard, enabling this option may break certain drivers(ie. Ethernet) and/or boot failures on other OSes, if it does happen then disable this option and opt for `npci` instead.
	- 2020+ BIOS Notes: When enabling Above4G, Resizable BAR Support may become an available on some X570 and newer motherboards. Please ensure this is **`DISABLED`** instead of set to Auto.
- EHCI/XHCI Hand-off
- OS type: Windows 8.1/10 UEFI Mode
- SATA Mode: AHCI
